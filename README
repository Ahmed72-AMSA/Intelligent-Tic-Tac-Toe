This project is an Artificial intelligence project for tic-tac-toe game (Player vs AI Agent) using following algorithms:- 
1- MinMax Algorithm.
2- MinMax Algorithm with alpha-beta burning.
3- MinMax with breadth first search Algorithm.
4- MinMax with hill climbing Algorithm.
5- Symmetric Reduction Algorithm.
6- best-first Algorithm.
7- heuristic reduction Algorithm.
8- symmetric reduction reduction Algorithm.

Download the code and enjoy it and try to beat my agent if you can , good luck :-)
